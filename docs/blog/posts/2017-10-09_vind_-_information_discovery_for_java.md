We all know it. When dealing with application development we often face the same problem again and again.
When a problem comes up for the first time you study it, think about a proper solution, search for fitting technology
and build the solution which fits best. On the second time, you reuse some code (by copy-paste), debug it and make it
fitting. Latest at the third time such a progress ... sucks. Copy-pasting often produces sub-optimal results and
(which is even worse) causes bugs that you have to find and fix. Additionally this enlarges the codebase you have to
maintain and forces you to develop and test new features for all the applications individually. 

In our case the recurring problem was the integration of custom search facilities including reporting, analysis,
personalization and recommendation - a topic that we call *Information Discovery* ID on which we are working on for almost a decade.
What we did is: we sat down, thought about proper scenarios and packaged these into a modular framework which provides you with an easy to use API, abstracts the
complexity of the real ID tasks and thus let you focus on the other parts of your application - things that you are experts in.

So let me kindly introduce Vind (faÉªnd) - a modular Java framework for Information Discovery.

## Do you know this issue? Then you are on the right place!

Let me start with a simple example. Imagine your application
